# collocations
extraction of collocations from a Farsi dataset

this project is for stemming a Farsi dataset and extracting its bigram and trigram collocations.

accessibility to this dataset needs permission of my bachelor's final project supervisor, Ahmad Yoosofan (https://faculty.kashanu.ac.ir/yoosofan/en)

thanks to my friend Mohammad Mollaahmadi
